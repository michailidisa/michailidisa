    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to make a comperative analysis between neighborhoods to help people who migrating to Scarborough, or even leave over there, to find a neighborhood for living and being able to compare the similarities of two cities. So, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters in order someone to be able to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, present features, which include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, in order someone to be able to make a comparative analysis between neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Which Tried to Solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorted list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n",
    "2. Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Location:\n",
    "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside and many would be interested in finding such \n",
    "\n",
    "## Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "In order someone to compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n",
